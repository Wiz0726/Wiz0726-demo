## Configure Git
<p>To configure Git on your system, you typically need to set up your username and email address, configure your default text editor, and optionally set other preferences. Here's a step-by-step guide:</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <b>Install Git:<b> If you haven't already installed Git, you can download and install it from the official website: <a href=https://git-scm.com/>git-scm.com.</a>
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Open a Terminal or Command Prompt:</b> Depending on your operating system, open a terminal or command prompt window.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Set Your Username:</b> Run the following command, replacing "Your Name" with your actual name: <br><i>git config --global user.name "Your Name"</i>
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Set Your Email Address:</b> Run the following command, replacing "your.email@example.com" with your actual email address: <br><i>git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"</i>
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Configure Your Default Text Editor (Optional):</b> Git uses a default text editor for various operations, such as writing commit messages. If you want to change the default editor, you can run a command like this: <br><i>git config --global core.editor "nano"</i> <br>Replace "nano" with the command for your preferred text editor, such as "vim", "emacs", "notepad++", or "subl" (for Sublime Text).
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Check Your Configuration:</b> You can verify your Git configuration by running: <br><i>git config --list</i> <br>This will display all your Git configuration settings.
  </li>
</ol>
<p>These are the basic configurations you'll typically set up when configuring Git. However, Git provides many other configuration options that you can explore based on your specific needs and preferences.</p>
